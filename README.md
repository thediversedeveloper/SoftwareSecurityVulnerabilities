The client Artemis Financical is a consulting company that devlops individualized financial plans for their customers including but not limited too savings, retirement, investments, and insurnace. They asked the company I work for Global Rain to develop customer software, and most current and efective software security. Specifically to protect their client data and information.

I made sure I used standard best practices to make sure my clients software security vulnerabilites were taken care of. I used a maven-check-dependency-report that checked for vulnerabilities. This website helps generate based off software secuirty protocols. It is important to code securely because it helps not only the client but the developer. By not coding correctly you can easily wipe someones bank account in this instance. Inline comments, and report checks are best practiced to help secure clean code. Have the ability to say that your company has software security allows the customer to feel safe with their data. This makes the person more likely to reccomend and use that company.

The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was trying to figure out how to read everything. I had to use my double screen to cross reference everytime I read something.

I added a checksum verification, and a hashing function adding multiple layers of security. Next time I would use similar steps in finding the vulnerabilties and using the maven-check-reports. I would add more layers of encryption based off customer need. In this case I would an extra two step verification.

I used the maven-check after supressing the files to review that I had no vulnerabilities.

In the future I would look back on multiples resources used in this course including the OWSAP resources, and the maven dependency check.

From this course I can verify code vulnerabilites easier and be able to show how to find them in the code. I would be able to talk about the importance of software security and how it goes hand in hand with clean well written code.
